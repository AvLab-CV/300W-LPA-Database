Using the face proﬁling approach, Zhu et al. offer the 300W-LP (Large-Pose) dataset that contains faces made from the 300W database [1] with each face rotated in yaw at 5◦ each step up to 90◦ [2]. On top of this dataset, we augment it with additional data made with rotation in pitch with the same 5◦ step up to ±25◦. We call this dataset the 300W-LPA (Large-Pose Augmented).

The database contains:
- Images: 366,564  photos of 59,439 individuals. 
- Landmark annotations:
  136 coordinates for 68 landmark points.
  The first 68 digits for x, the latter 68 for y
